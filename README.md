# Hi, I'm Gulshan 👋

### 💻 Embedded Systems & Low-Level Programming Enthusiast

I specialize in high-performance, resource-constrained environments, focusing on the intersection of **C/C++**, **Embedded Systems**, and **Linux Systems Programming**. I thrive on optimizing system performance, managing concurrency, and building reliable solutions from bare metal up to the network layer.

### 🛠 Core Technical Stack

| **Area** | **Expertise** |
| :--- | :--- |
| **System Languages** | C, Modern C++ (C++17/20), Assembly (ARM) |
| **Embedded Systems** | RTOS (FreeRTOS), Device Drivers (I2C, SPI, UART), STM32/ESP32, Bare-Metal |
| **Linux Systems** | POSIX APIs, Multithreading (pthreads), Inter-Process Communication (IPC: Semaphores, Shared Memory), `fork()`/`exec()` |
| **Networking** | TCP/UDP Socket Programming (C), Non-blocking I/O (`epoll`/`select`), Protocol Analysis |
| **Tools & Versioning** | Git, GDB, Valgrind, CMake, Docker |

### 🚀 Featured Projects

I believe in demonstrating skills through robust projects. You'll find repositories here covering:

* **High-Concurrency Network Servers** built with raw C sockets and thread pools.

* **Real-time Firmware** for microcontrollers handling sensor data acquisition.

* **Custom Linux Utilities** exploring core OS concepts and system calls.
